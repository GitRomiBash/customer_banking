Module 3 Challenge: Customer Banking

To begin, import the functions create_savings_account and create_cd_account from their respective modules.

Next, define the main function. This function will prompt the user to enter the balance, interest rate, and length of time for both their savings and CD accounts. The function will then calculate the interest earned on both accounts and update the balances accordingly.

First, prompt the user to enter their savings account balance, interest rate, and maturity time. Store these values as variables.

Pass these variables to the create_savings_account function and store the returned values as updated_savings_balance and interest_earned.

Print out the interest earned and updated savings account balance with interest earned for the given months.

Next, prompt the user to enter their CD account balance, interest rate, and length of time. Store these values as variables.

Pass these variables to the create_cd_account function and store the returned values as updated_cd_balance and interest_earned.

Print out the interest earned and updated CD account balance with interest earned for the given months.
